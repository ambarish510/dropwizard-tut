Describe the problem statement mentioned in problem.txt

Step 0:
    Get the sample main working for everyone with some sample arguments

Step 1:
    Simple dropwizard application with Hello API
    *just another java program
    *lifecycle of a dropwizard application
    *dropwizard as integration of different libraries with unified config (in most cases)
    */hello?name=durga
    *:admin port
    	show metrics, healthcheck

	#Exercise trace the path from main till run    	


Intro to important libraries
    jetty for http
    jersey (jax-rs) for rest
    jackson for json
    logback (slf4j) for logging
    etc

Dropwizard's lifecycle
    bootstraps and calls initialize
        during which you can add bundles, override objectmapper, add commands
    Parses cli and config and handles over to corresponding command
    Server command - calls the run in Application during which we can resources, filters, healthchecks, managed etc


Step 2:
    User Resource
    *Jackson deserialization
    *NotNull sample
    *use lombok
    ?touch on thread contention
    #Exercise @JsonSnakeCase is a dropwizard annotation why does that work


Step 3:
    Hibernate integration
    *dbmigrate, how and why?
    *Dropwizard commands server,db
    #Exercise HealthCheck warning is gone? why

Step 4:
    UserDAO
    *querying the database
    *transaction / UnitOfWork



Step 5:
    Jersey Client
    *client usage
    *seperate module
    *adapter pattern

    #Exercise how does Client know json serialization/deserialization?	

    imp of throwing exceptions

Step 6:
    Hystrix integration
    *why and how
    *dependency management, async execution, monitoring, short circuiting
    *executor pattern

    #Exercise read up rx-java and tryout command::observe

Step 7:
    Guice Integration
    *why DI, testing, Single Responsibility & seperation of concerns
    #Exercise guice assist to DI the hystrix Commands


Bundles
   a parallel lifecycle to Dropwizard's Application. Allows to move similar components into a bundle.
    Essentially a way to segregate the code in Application
    *assests bundle allows exposing all files like a apache servers www dir
    *migrations bunlde adds needed commands for migrations



Commands
    Allows dropwizard to be used a cli tool
    *server command is the one that provides the http framework
    *db commands allow db migrations
    *we can have a command to download config from conman or config service

HealthCheck:
    Helps in monitoring the health of different dependencies of the system
    *used in bring a box out of rotation in flipkart
    *adding hibernate bundle adds a db healthcheck


Tasks
    enables running some maintance tasks
    *can be used to manager things like clear/warm a inmemory cache
    *can be used to increase of decrease the thread/memory pool for something
    *dropwizard 9 and above provide a task to change log level

Managed
    attach to lifecycle of dropwizard
    *start and stop to manage i.e start and stop thread pools, connection pools
